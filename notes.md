## Meeting 07/01/2020

### Meeting goal
- Leave with a clear(ish) picture of what his research will
  look like and have a rough road map to get there.
   
#### Project questions
- What is an appropriate project scope. E.g., Greg made it
  sound like analysis of existing data or even a
  comprehensive literature review would be adequate.

- What is Hamish's ambition?

### Things for Hamish to learn
- rule-based vs information-integration category learning
- procedural vs declarative learning and memory <--> anatomy

### Admin issues
- Do we maintain an official relationship in any capacity?
- Timeline to complete project

**Jenny Batchelor**
**Greg Savage**

### questions about any of the papers so far?


### More general questions?


## COVIS
> For instance, COVIS does not include a model of the
> ventral striatum (e.g., nucleus accumbens). This region is
> thought to play a major role in reversal learning and
> feedback processing (e.g., Cools, Altamirano, &
> DʼEsposito, 2006) and, as a result, the present model
> could not account for reversal learning data without
> adding additional assumptions (which is not in line with
> the goal of this work). For this reason, we avoid
> simulating tasks that include major feedback manipulations
> in this article.


> As such, the effect of dopaminergic medication cannot be
> modeled using the current computational implementation of
> COVIS.

- Does this argument invalidate Frank's work?


> The specific effects of some of these drugs is still
> unclear (e.g., anticholinergics), and to complicate things
> even further, a number of drugs have complex interactions
> that are poorly understood.

- Seems like a tremendous amount of work to be done to
  partition out what cognitive effects are manifest with
  what medications.

- Another tremendous amount of work to be done is to
  partition out how various computational models have dealt
  with the various cognitive deficits.

- High DA -> very little "rule-based guessing"

> COVIS assumes that switching of executive attention is
> mediated within the head of the caudate nucleus, and that
> the parameter γ is inversely related to basal ganglia DA
> levels (for a detailed argument, see Ashby et al., 1998).

- High DA -> small gamma -> switching will be easy

>  COVIS assumes that a cortical network including the
>  anterior cingulate and the prefrontal cortex mediates
>  selection, and that λ increases with cortical DA levels
>  (for a detailed argument, see Ashby et al., 1998).

- Less clear what decreased DA -> decreased selection
  parameter will do.
  
> When a > 1, the selection becomes more deterministic – the
> rule with the greatest weight is almost always chosen.
> Hence, a can be interpreted as a gain parameter and, as
> such, COVIS assumes that a increases with cortical DA
> (Ashby & Casale, 2003; for similar arguments, see
> Durstewitz & Seamans, 2008; Frank, 2005; Moustafa & Gluck,
> 2010).

- Basically just connecting everything in the model to rule
  selection / switching.
